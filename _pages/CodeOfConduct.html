            <h2>Code of conduct and enforcement</h2>

            <p>This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all attendees, including
            organisers, of the Binder Workshops. This code also details steps for reporting
            unacceptable behaviour. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event.
            We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment
            for everybody.</p>

            <p>The organisers of the workshops are committed to providing a harassment-free
            work environment for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and
            expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size,
            race, age, religion or work experience. We do not tolerate harassment of event
            participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for
            any professional event. Event participants violating these rules may be
            sanctioned or expelled from the event without any pecuniary reimbursement
            at the discretion of the organisers.</p>

            <p>We also have a set of<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/participation-guidelines">
              Participation guidelines</a> for the events events.</p>


            <p>Harassment includes, but is not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to
                gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability,
                physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion or work experience</li>
                <li>Sexual images in public spaces</li>
                <li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following</li>
                <li>Harassing photography or recording</li>
                <li>Sustained disruption of the Event</li>
                <li>Uninvited physical contact</li>
                <li>Unwelcome sexual attention</li>
                <li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Anything that makes someone feel uncomfortable could be deemed
              harassment.
            For more information about what constitutes harassment and examples, please
            refer to <a href="http://www.opencon2017.org/code_of_conduct">
            OpenCon’s Code of Conduct in Brief</a>
             and the <a href="http://openhardware.science/gosh-2017/gosh-code-of-conduct/">
             Gathering for Open Source Hardware’s examples of behaviour</a>
           </p>

           <h2>Enforcement</h2>
           <p>Participants (including organisers) asked to stop any harassing
              behaviour are expected to comply immediately. If a participant
              engages in harassing behaviour, event organisers retain the right
              to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for
               all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion
               from the event.</p>

            <p>Event organisers may take action to redress anything designed to
              disrupt, or with the clear impact of disrupting, the event or
              making the environment hostile for any participants.</p>

            <p>We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues
              (including online) and event-related social activities.</p>

            <h2>Reporting</h2>

            <p>If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome,
              please report it as soon as possible. Harassment and other Code
              of Conduct violations reduce the value of our event for everyone.
               We want you to be happy at our event. People like you make our
               event a better place.</o>

            <p>You can make a report either personally or anonymously.

              shared at the start of the event. You can also contact <a href="https://twitter.com/gedankenstuecke">Bastian Greshake Tzovaras</a> (bgreshake@googlemail.com)
